# Driver Drowsiness Detection AI Project
This solution includes identifying key attributes of drowsiness to detect whether alert or drowsy i.e. Driver drowsiness detection via eye and mouth monitoring being it closed or opened using Python, OpenCV.

**1.Pre_Processing_&_Feature_Extraction** - Pre processing of dataset videos into frames to label them and to extract suitable features for the classification model based on the facial landmarks that was extracted from the frames of the videos.

**2.Normalization** - To normalize the features of each individual, first three frames were taken for each individualâ€™s alert video and  were used as the baseline for normalization.

**3.Classification_Models** - Basic classification models and other deep learning approaches.

**4.LSTM** - LSTM networks are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), capable of learning long-term dependencies in the data.

**5.Main_Code** -Implementing the model to predict new frames as alert or drowsy.

**6.Graphs Folder** : Contains all the output graphs produced from the codes.
